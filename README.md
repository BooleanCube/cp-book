# **C**ompetitive **P**rogramming Book
This is a book written by **BooleanCube** for Competitive Programming!

## How to use the **C**ompetitive **P**rogramming Book
The wiki folder gives you access to the book online itself on github. However, I recommend you just download the HTML version of the book since it is more legible and a bit more appealing to the eyes and has easier file navigation. The HTML folder is the folder named CPBook<version> and the online version to view on github is called "Wiki".
